NCI Research Overview
 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is part of the National Institutes of
                                Health (NIH), which is one of 11 agencies that compose the
                                Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The NCI, established under the National Cancer
                                Institute Act of 1937, is the Federal Government's principal agency for cancer research and training. The
                                National Cancer Act of 1971 broadened the scope and responsibilities of the NCI and created the
                                National Cancer Program. 
                            The National Cancer Institute coordinates the National Cancer Program, which conducts and
                                supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other programs with respect to
                                the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer, rehabilitation from cancer, and the
                                continuing care of cancer patients and the families of cancer patients. Specifically, the
                                Institute:
                            
                             Conducts research in its own laboratories and clinics.
                                Supports and coordinates research projects conducted by universities, hospitals,
                                    research foundations, and businesses throughout this country and abroad through research
                                    grants and cooperative agreements.
                               
                                Supports education and training in fundamental sciences and clinical disciplines for
                                    participation in basic and clinical research programs and treatment programs relating to
                                    cancer through career awards, training grants, and fellowships.
                                Collects and disseminates information on cancer.

   Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS)

                                DCCPS aims to reduce risk, incidence, and deaths from cancer as well as enhance the
                                    quality of life for cancer survivors. The division conducts and supports an integrated
                                    program of the highest quality genetic, epidemiological, behavioral, social, applied, and
                                    surveillance cancer research. DCCPS-funded research aims to understand the causes and
                                    distribution of cancer in populations, support the development and delivery of effective
                                    interventions, and monitor and explain cancer trends in all segments of the population.
                                    Central to these activities is the process of synthesis and decision making that aids in
                                    evaluating what has been learned, identifying new priorities and strategies, and effectively
                                    applying research discoveries to reduce the cancer burden.

Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD)
                                The multidisciplinary staff members of DCTD identify the most promising areas of science
                                    and technology for development of better diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for
                                    patients with cancer.
                                The division takes prospective detection and treatment leads, facilitates their paths to
                                    clinical application, and expedites the initial and subsequent large-scale testing of new
                                    agents and interventions in patients. By determining the highest priority questions that can
                                    be examined in the laboratory and through clinical trials, DCTD ensures that appropriate
                                    mechanisms and resources are available for the development of novel interventions for the
                                    wide range of cancers affecting children and adults.
                                DCTD scientists support programs to pursue high-risk research that may yield great
                                    benefits for patients with cancer but may be too difficult or risky for industry or academia
                                    to undertake. This includes a particular emphasis on the development of unique molecular
                                    signatures for cancer and molecular assays and imaging techniques that will guide oncologic
                                    therapy in the future.
