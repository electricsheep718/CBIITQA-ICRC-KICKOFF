                   	Reference letters should be written by individuals who have knowledge of your academic and career interests, abilities, accomplishments, and preparedness for scientific research. Select someone who knows you well and can speak specifically on your behalf. Research mentors are recommended as a good starting point. Previous or current professors or employers can also provide letters.
                   	 Upon submission of your application, an e-mail will automatically be sent to each reference requesting that he/she complete an online letter of reference.
